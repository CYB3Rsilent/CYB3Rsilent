👋 Hi, I’m @CYB3Rsilent
- 👀 I’m interested in Offensive Cyber Security. Red Team Operations to be exact. 
- 🌱 I am about to start a BootCamp and setting up a GitHub account is pre-work for the course. I have used GitHub a couple of time just trying to learn the craft, but I don’t know much about it. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on just about anything if you are patient and willing to let me learn as I go. I am what most would consider a jack of all trades, and this is my most recent tool to learn for my bag of tricks. 
- 📫 I can be reached here for now, once I am a little more familiar with this platform I will add more information.
